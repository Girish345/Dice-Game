# How to Use

Once the game starts, you will be prompted to roll the dice by pressing the Enter key. The game will then display the value of the dice and add it to your current score. You can continue rolling the dice as many times as you want, but if you roll a 1, your turn ends and you lose all the points you've accumulated during that turn.

The goal of the game is to reach a score of 100 or more. Once you reach that score, the game will end and you will be declared the winner.
